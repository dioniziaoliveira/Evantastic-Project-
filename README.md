 Evantastic Project 

> The system to be developed consists of an event management application designed to support the entire process of organizing, registering for, and participating in activities such as conferences, workshops, or thematic meetings. The organizing institution regularly holds events aimed at both students and non-students, but the current process, based on scattered forms and design sheets, makes it difficult to control registrations, deadlines, and payments. The goal is to create a centralized system that allows managing multiple events simultaneously, enables participants to register online, handles payments associated with each registration, and facilitates check-in on the day of the event.

## About This Documentation

Events often involve complex coordination, especially when multiple participants, sessions, workshops, payment categories, and logistics are involved. Traditional methods relying on spreadsheets, printed documents, and disconnected registration forms make operations slow, error-prone, and difficult to audit.
